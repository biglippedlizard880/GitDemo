    Lorem Ipsum is 
    simply dummy text of 
    the printing and typesetting industry. 
    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's 
    standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
    when an unknown printer took a galley of 
    type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

    It has survived not only five centuries, but also the 
    leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
    It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets 
    containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently 
    with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum
